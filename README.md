# Problem domain: 
Waste management using recommended recipes 

# High-level description
- User inputs groceries and their corresponding expiration dates
- Inputs will be then sent to a database to keep track of user’s current grocery inventory
- The program will receive the classified ingredients from the database, and will identify which grocery items will expire soon
- The program will use those grocery items as a metric to search for recipes that include those items as to minimize food waste
- The program will return a list of recipes that the user can cook using their ingredients and potentially additional items
- The user will also be able to filter recipes by dietary preferences (restrictions, calorie intake, macros, etc.)
- Once the user selects a recipe, the required ingredients for that recipe that user has will be removed from the database to match the user’s current inventory
